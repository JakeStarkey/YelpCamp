# YelpCamp

YelpCamp is a website designed to show a complete, hostable website using front end and back end technology. 

It is designed to mimic Yelp for custom, user-input campsites around the country. This project is the final project in the Colt Steele Web Development Bootcamp Udemy course. 

#Commit-1
This branch was created to show bootcamp integration for easier front-end viewing. Currently, YelpCamp only has CRUD editability and simple styling.
