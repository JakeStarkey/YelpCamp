# YelpCamp

YelpCamp is a website designed to show a complete, hostable website using front end and back end technology. 

It is designed to mimic Yelp for custom, user-input campsites around the country. This project is the final project in the Colt Steele Web Development Bootcamp Udemy course. 

## Commit 3: Reviews

Added reviews to each campground! While no authentication or users have been set up yet, each campground now has the ability to store individual reviews to it via one-to-many relationships.
