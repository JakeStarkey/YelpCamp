# YelpCamp

YelpCamp is a website designed to show a complete, hostable website using front end and back end technology. 

It is designed to mimic Yelp for custom, user-input campsites around the country. This project is the final project in the Colt Steele Web Development Bootcamp Udemy course. 

## Validation

This branch is dedicated to showing added validation for all async routes but especially for the new.ejs and show.ejs files. The middleware, schemas.js, now handles all invalid post requests that can make it through the client-side validation on all forms.

This is done using Joi which handles the validated object.
