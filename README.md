# YelpCamp

YelpCamp is a website designed to show a complete, hostable website using front end and back end technology. 

It is designed to mimic Yelp for custom user-input campsites around the country. This project uses API's, custom middleware, and full stack techniques to deliver a product for storing, reviewing and editing information submitted by users registered through the website.
