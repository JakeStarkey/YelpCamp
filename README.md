# Controllers and Updated Review Sections

This update includes new file setups for route controllers and a new star system for reviews. 

Reviews are still needing to be finalized. Future updates should include an optional title section and not being able to submit a zero-star rating. Right now, I have implemented a workaround to the zero-star rating by making it default to one-star after submission. I'm working to see if there is a way I can mess with the CSS to start the stars at one instead of zero.
